    "# Agent-Environment Interface\n",
    "In RL we have an agent interacting with an environment. At every timestep $t$ the agent observes the state $s_t$ of the environment and choses an action $a_t$ to perform. Given the agent's action, the environment gives the agent a reward $r_t$ and transitions to a new state $s_{t+1}$. This interaction is known as the agent-environment interface and is given by the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Agent-Environment Interface](../images/agent-environment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement this interface in code by building an Agent class and an Environment class. The Agent class should have a method `choose_action(state)` which, given a `state`, returns a valid `action`. The Environment should have a method `step(action)` which, given an `action`, should perform the given `action` in the environment and return the `next_state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to represent the `state` of an environment is to use a feature vector. Each element in the vector represents a feature of the environment. As an example lets implement a simple grid-world environment where an agent needs to navigate from the bottom left of the grid-world to the top right. We can represent the `state` of the environment by a vector of the agent's x- and y-coordinates. In Python we can implement vectors using the `numpy` library."
